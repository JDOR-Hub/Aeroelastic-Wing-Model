# Decomposition of Flutter into Basic Aeroelastic Vibration Modes on Wing Surface 

## Description
The paper focuses on the study of the aeroelastic behavior of wing surfaces, where vibrations arise from the interaction between airflow and wing geometry. The Fast Fourier Transform is used to decompose these vibrations into fundamental modes, crucial for aerodynamic design. The process involves a numerical analysis to solve differential equations resulting from the mathematical analysis that explains the flutter. This study contributes to the understanding and control of aeroelastic vibrations on wing surfaces, a critical aspect in aerospace engineering and aircraft design.
